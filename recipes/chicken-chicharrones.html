        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Optional spices: paprika, garlic powder, or your choice of seasoning</li>
        <li>Oil for frying (if not baking)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Clean the chicken skins and pat them dry with paper towels. Remove any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Season the skins on both sides with salt, pepper, and any optional spices you like.</li>
        <li>For baking: Lay the skins flat on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place another piece of parchment paper on top of the skins, then another baking sheet on top to keep them flat while baking.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until crispy and golden brown. For frying: Fry in batches in the hot oil until crispy and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the skins from the oven or oil and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve your chicken skin chicharrones hot, with your choice of dipping sauce on the side.</li>
